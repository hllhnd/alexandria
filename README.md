# alexandria
Shoddy tool for automatically organizing a FLAC collection into a directory structure based on metadata

# Usage
`cd` into the directory of your FLAC collection and run `alexandria`. Alexandria will show you a preview of how it will reorganize your FLACs in the format `src -> dst`. Enter `y` if you approve of the changes, and Alexandria will perform the reorganization.

Note that Alexandria is not tested for metadataless FLACs. Don't yell at me if it implodes.
